                    <div class="ctn2-para1">Alight India Foundation was initiated in 2002 when a group of friends came together with the intention of giving back to society. They were inspired by the thought and philosophy of Peter Senge, the founder of the Society for Organizational Learning, who has propagated that "sustainability, social equality, and the environment are now business problems..." and corporate leaders can’t expect governments to solve them alone. Alight India Foundation focuses on helping people with food, shelter, and children's education, striving to create a brighter future for those in need.</div>
                    <div class="ctn2-para2">What triggered these thoughts was the liberalization of the Indian economy in the 1990s, which brought immense opportunities. Business revived, and India became not just a market but also an investment prospect for the developed world. Disposable incomes and early settlements became a living reality for the working middle class. For the first time in India, professionals could think beyond making a living and contribute towards society. This economic shift inspired the founding members of Alight India Foundation to leverage their resources and skills to help people with food, shelter, and children's education, aiming to make a positive impact on society.</div>
                    <div class="ctn2-para1">Fueled with enthusiasm, the founders of Alight India Foundation gave shape to their dream, and Alight India Foundation was born. Over the last two decades, Alight has evolved as a sustainable Indian social institution – committed to doing real work on the ground and making society and businesses inclusive in the process of bringing change.</div>
                    <div class="ctn2-para2">On our journey, we had to make many difficult choices and constantly innovate – whether it was choosing to work on the ground through a service-delivery approach, practicing management principles and adopting a business-like approach in the development sector, creating a unique resource model keeping businesses at the center, or promoting the concept of civic-driven change. Yes, we almost always took the road less traveled, and as they say, that has made all the difference!</div>

                    <div class="ctn2-para1">While our focus as a development organization has been first and foremost to work on the ground to bring positive change in the lives of less privileged children and families, we have equally strived to sustain this change by sensitizing and engaging the privileged masses towards their social responsibility. Not remaining restricted to the community, and with the aim of achieving sustainable development in a wider social context, Alight India Foundation has adopted the principle of Civic Driven Change, making civil society an active partner in all its welfare initiatives.</div>

                    <div class="ctn2-para1">We believe that education is both the means and the end to a better life: the means because it empowers individuals to earn their livelihood, and the end because it increases awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behavior to understanding one’s rights – and in the process helps them evolve as better citizens. Education is the most effective tool which helps children build a strong foundation, enabling them to free themselves from the vicious cycle of ignorance, poverty, and disease.</div>

                            Social Venture Philanthropy (SVP) is an innovative model based on the business concept of venture capital. Under SVP, Alight India Foundation identifies and implements its development projects through credible community-based organizations. We also support and build the capacities of these organizations, focusing on achieving scalability and sustainability, creating a culture of leadership and excellence, and inculcating a deep sense of accountability among them.</div>

                            Under the Outreach model, Alight India Foundation directly implements development interventions, as this approach requires intensive and professional engagement for wider and sustained outcomes. While working in remote rural areas, we realized that intensive on-ground intervention is needed, which might be beyond the capacity of community-based organizations. Therefore, we directly implement such projects, liaising with local community stakeholders to achieve better social returns on investment.</div>
